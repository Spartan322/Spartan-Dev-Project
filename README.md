# Spartan Dev Project
![](images/logo_256.png)

The Spartan Dev Project is Game Dev Tycoon mod API system that aims to have a source written in [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) with Object Oriented script paradigms in mind, clear cut and extensive documentation, and adding much more complex and advanced features in a simplistic system, as well as wrapping around the very old yet well known modding API UltimateLib to get old mods back upto speed with very minimal work.

### Contribution Setup
In order to develop for this project, you must have coffeescript installed and readily available on your computer:

1. Install npm ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) recommended)

2. After installing npm, install coffeescript using 'npm install -g coffee-script' (if you prefer a local installation, you must manage outputting to js manually)

3. With the global install, open your terminal/cmd, go to this directory, and type 'output'


### Coming Soon
A new documentation system for Coffeescript called SpartaDoc will be an open-source release, making documenting coffeescript APIs easier (may eventually incorperate Javascript), will be akin to Doxygen in many ways
